Using Multiple DaoAI Cameras
=============================

DaoAI offers two camera series, the Bin Picking series (BP-S, BP-M, BP-L, BP-AMR, BP-AMR-GPU) and the Inspection series (IN-S, IN-M, IN-L).

Normally, if multiple cameras are physically connected, they will all appear in the camera selection list. 
However, DaoAI Camera Studio only supports establishing a connection with a single camera at a time.
To capture with multiple cameras using DaoAI Camera Studio, start another instance of DaoAI Camera Studio.
