Frames
=======

Frames are used to adjust exposure stop, brightness, and gain levels that are applied when doing captures. Camera Studio allows you to add multiple frames with different settings 
to capture multiple image groups and fine tune the quality of your resulting images.

**Exposure Stop**

Responsible for adjusting the exposure time. The level of exposure stops are -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. By moving the exposure stop by 1 increment, the pixel intensity should 
approximately double. The most commonly used exposure levels are -1, 0, and 1.

**Brightness**

Responsible for adjusting the brightness of the image. The possible values are 1, 2, 3. Again, each incremental change will affect the intensity by a factor of 2.

|

**Gain**

Responsible for increasing the ISO value or sensitivity of the camera. The span ranges from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 where 0 is the base point 0dB and 4 corresponds to the highest value 
24dB (each slider increment causes 6dB change). When the gain is increased or decreased by 6dB, the gain effect is twice as much as that of the previous one. The conversion 
formula is: 20 x log (gain multiple) = + /-gain dB value.

**Adding Frames**

When an image does not meet the expected requirements, you can achieve more precise exposure levels by frames by adding more frames and with different exposure file settings. 
For example, two frames set 2 different exposure values as -1 and 0 respectively to make up for the situation that a single frame -1 is too dark or a single frame 0 is too bright.
