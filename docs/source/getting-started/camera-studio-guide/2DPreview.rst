2D Preview
===========

The 2D Preview feature is used to retrive a preview image of the scene before you perform a capture

To perform a 2D Preview, click "Show 2D Preview" in the frame drop down menu corresponding to the one you want previewed. The preview will automatically appear in the “2D Camera 
Preview” visual tab. If the frame settings is collapsed, you can click the “eye” icon in order to preview that frame. In the “2D Camera Preview” tab, if the image has red spots, 
that means those pixels are overexposed under the current frame settings.

If there exists a 2D Camera Preview, you can click on the color picker icon in the top bar of the main window in order to find the RGB values of the pixel at your cursor's 
position in the image preview. The values will be updated on the top bar as well as displayed on the bottom left corner.
