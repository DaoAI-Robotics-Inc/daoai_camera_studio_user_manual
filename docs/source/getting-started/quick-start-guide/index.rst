            3D cameras use active lighting to detect your target objects. 
            |br| To minimize direct reflections from the background and reduce
            |br| potential artifacts, it is recommended that you mount
            |br| your camera at a slight angle to get the best results. 
            |br| You can test different positions in DaoAI Studio.
