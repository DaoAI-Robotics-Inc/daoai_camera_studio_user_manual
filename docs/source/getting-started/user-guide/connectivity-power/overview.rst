Connecting to the computer
-----------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: BP SAMLL

    1. Plug the power supply first into the "24V"
    2. Plug the ethernet cable into the camera and connect it to your computer
    3. Plug the power supply into a power outlet.

    .. note::
        On disconnect, follow the procedure in reverse, disconnect mains power first. 
        |br| Ensure that all connections are screwed in tightly. The coupling nut of the M12 screw connectors can in some cases be hard do screw in. However, when installed correctly they provide a robust and reliable connection.       
        |br| Check :ref:`System Requirements` for performance considerations

    Use the AC/DC adapter supplied with the unit to ensure compliance with emission and immunity standards.

    The DaoAI BP Small camera is protected against reverse polarity and against overheating by a thermistor that physically removes the power.

    The DaoAI BP Small camera is protected against reverse polarity and against overheating by a thermistor that physically removes the power.

    The DaoAI BP Small camera uses Ethernet communication and needs 10 Gbps for best performance. Your computer may not have a port for 10 Gigabit Ethernet. In that case, you can connect to it using an adaptor for 10GBASE-T (10 Gbps copper Ethernet) to Thunderbolt 3. At a reduced performance you can also use 1000BASE-T and NBASE-T (1 Gbps, 2.5 Gbps, and 5 Gbps over copper) to USB adapters.

    .. caution::
       USB-based network adapters have reduced and more variable capture speed, and can occasionally give errors when using the camera. Our recommendation is to use 10Gb PCI Express cards for optimal performance. 
   
    
    Network Topology
        The DaoAI BP Small camera supports the following network topologies:

    .. list-table::
        :widths: 25 25 
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Direct connection
          - Connection via switch
        * - .. image:: images/amrc.png

          - .. image:: images/amrswitch.png
