Connecting to the computer
-----------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: BP SMALL

    1. Plug the power supply first into the "24V "
    2. Plug the ethernet cable into the camera and connect it to your computer
    3. Plug the power supply into a power outlet.

    .. note::
        On disconnect, follow the procedure in reverse, disconnect mains power first. 
        |br| Ensure that all connections are screwed in tightly. 
        |br| Check :ref:`System Requirements` for performance considerations

    Use the AC/DC adapter supplied with the unit to ensure compliance with emission and immunity standards.

    The DaoAI BP Small camera uses Ethernet communication and needs 1 Gbps for  performance. 
    
    Network Topology
        The DaoAI BP Small camera supports the following network topologies:
