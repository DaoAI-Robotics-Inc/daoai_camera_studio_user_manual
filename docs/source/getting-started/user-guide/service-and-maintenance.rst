Service and Maintenance
========================

The device contains no user-serviceable parts inside. The product warranty will be void if opened.

Follow the below instructions to ensure that your Zivid camera is well maintained:

- Check screw connections and connectors at regular intervals.

- Do not block the air opening on the front and rear sides of the product.

- The unit uses active and passive cooling, allow some space around the device for airflow.

- Use a small vacuum cleaner or a small canister of compressed air to remove dust or other accumulated particles. This applies to both the glasses and in between the ribs of the heat sink.

- Regularly `clean optical glass parts of the device`.

- Check and update the calibration on a yearly basis by performing :ref:`Infield Correction` (and :ref:`Hand-Eye Calibration`) when necessary.
