Service and Maintenance
========================

All of the DaoAI Cameras contain no user-serviceable parts inside. The product warranty will be void if opened.

Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your DaoAI camera is well maintained:

- Check screw connections and connectors at regular intervals.

- The cameras use passive cooling, please allow some space around the device for optimal airflow.

- To remove dust or other accumulated particles, it is recommended to use a small vacuum cleaner or a small canister of compressed air. This applies to both the glasses and in between the ribs of the heat sink.

- Regularly clean optical glass parts of the device. Please refer to :ref:`Cleaning Instructions` for more details.

- Check and update the calibration on a yearly basis by performing Infield Correction (and Hand-Eye Calibration) when necessary.
