System Requirements
=========================

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 0

    * - **OS**
      - Windows 10 or Linux Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04

    * - **Dedicated GPU**
      - A dedicated GPU gives the best performance with DaoAI Camera Studio. 
      
        It is also the best choice if the GPU will be used for more than DaoAIâ€™s 
        
        computations. A medium to high-end AMD or NVIDIA GPU with at least 
        
        3 GB of memory is required for optimal performance. This is the 
        
        preferred solution for DaoAI Camera Studio.
            
            Recommendations:
                - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti or better
                - NVIDIA GeForce MX150 or better
                - AMD Radeon RX 550 or bette  

    * - **CPU with integrated GPU**
      - This is the most cost-efficient solution for DaoAI Camera Studio. 
      
        The benefit of an integrated GPU is that the data transfer from GPU 
        
        to CPU is fast. A high-end integrated GPU with at least 3 GB of 
        
        memory available is required for optimal performance.

            Recommendations:
                - AMD Ryzen 5 2400G or better 2 4
                - Intel i7 with HD630 or better
    * - **USB**
      - SuperSpeed USB3 port
         
    * - **Ethernet**
      - Full performance:

        - 10GBASE-T (10G Copper Ethernet) adapter connected via 
          
          PCI Express or Thunderbolt 3
        
        
        Reduced performance:
        
        - 1000BASE-T and NBASE-T (1G, 2.5G, and 5G over 
          
          copper) connections

.. tip::
    Use CPU with integrated GPU for applications that require low power consumption, e.g., battery powered mobile platforms with cameras.
