    * - **OS**
      - Windows 10 or Linux Ubuntu 20.04

    * - **Dedicated GPU**
      - A dedicated GPU gives the best performance with DaoAI Camera Studio. 
      
        It is also the best choice if the GPU will be used for more than DaoAIâ€™s 
        
        computations. A medium to high-end NVIDIA GPU with at least 3 GB 
        
        of memory is required for optimal performance. This is the 
        
        preferred solution for DaoAI Camera Studio.
            
            Recommendations:
                - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti or better
                - NVIDIA GeForce MX150 or better  

    * - **USB**
      - SuperSpeed USB3 port
