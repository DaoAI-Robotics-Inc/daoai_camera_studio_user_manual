Capturing
==========

This page will provide instructions on how perform captures in Camera Studio.

There are three capture modes to choose from in Camera Studio:

1. **Capture** performs a single capture using the current frames.
2. **Auto** performs a single capture using automatically calculated capture settings.
3. **Live** performs continuous captures using the current frames.
