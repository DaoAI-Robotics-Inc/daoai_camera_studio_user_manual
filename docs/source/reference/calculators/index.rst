Calculate Depth of View
---------------------------

The depth of field (DOF) is the range within which the object can move away from or towards the camera without resulting in a blurred image. 
The calculator below estimates the depth of field, which can guide you to position your camera and object.

Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ./images/input.png

- Circle of Confusion (in micrometers, Î¼m)

.. note:: 
    If you have ``acceptable blur radius`` > 1, then you multiply the ``Circle of Confusion`` by ``acceptable blur radius``.

- Focal length of lens (in millimeters, mm)

- aperture of the lens

- Working distance in millimeters
