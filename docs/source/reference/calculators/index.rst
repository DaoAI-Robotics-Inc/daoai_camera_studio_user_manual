Calculate Depth of View
---------------------------

The depth of field (DOF) is the range within which the object can move away from or towards the camera without resulting in a blurred image. 
The calculator below estimates the depth of field, which can guide you to position your camera and object.

Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~
