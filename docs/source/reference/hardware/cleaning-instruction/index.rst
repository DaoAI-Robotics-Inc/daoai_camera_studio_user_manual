Cleaning Instructions
=========================================

Stains on the optical glass parts can interfere with the light signal passing through and thus affect the point cloud quality. Therefore, check and maintain the optical glass parts regularly.

.. caution::
    Do not touch the glass parts with fingers to avoid staining.

If the glass parts are stained, follow the instructions for cleaning optical components:

    1. Remove as much dust and dirt as possible with a blower or soft-bristled brush.

    2. Apply a few drops of lens cleaning solution to a lens tissue (lint-free wipes) or cleaning cloth.

    3. Using a circular motion, gently remove grease, fingerprints, and grime from the surface, working from the center outward.
