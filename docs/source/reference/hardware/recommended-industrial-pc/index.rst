Recommended Industrial PCs
==================================

The table below shows recommended PC specs from High-End to Low-End grades. The expected capture speed increases from the bottom row to the top row.

+----------+---------------+---------------+--------+------------+-------------------+
|  Grade   |    CPU        | Intergrated   |  RAM   |  Ethernet  |  Dedicated GPU    |

+==========+===============+===============+========+============+===================+
|          |               |               |        |            | Nvidia GTX 1080TI |
| High-End |               |               |  16 GB |            | or GTX 1080       |
|          |               |               |        |            |                   |
+----------+  Intel i5 or  |  Intel UHD    +--------+            +-------------------+
|          |  similar      |  630/750/770  |        |  1  GigE   | Nvidia GTX 1070   |
| Mid-End  |  AMD          |  or similar   |        |            | or GTX 1660       |
|          |               |  AMD          |        |            |                   |
+----------+               |               |  8 GB  |            +-------------------+
|          |               |               |        |            | Nvidia GTX 1650   |
| Low-End  |               |               |        |            | or GTX 1050Ti     |
|          |               |               |        |            |                   |

.. note::
    A 1 GigE network card provides better performance than a dedicated GPU. As a consequence, it is cheaper to get a Mid-End than a Low-End+ IPC for DaoAI camera.

The PC budget should be first spent on the components in the table. If the budget is higher, your spending should roughly be done in this order:

- Upgrading the GPU to 1060 or similar

- Upgrading the CPU to i7 or similar

- Upgrading the GPU to RTX 2080

- Upgrading the CPU to i9

- Upgrading the RAM to 64 GB
