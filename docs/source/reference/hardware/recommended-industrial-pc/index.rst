The PC budget should be first spent on the components in the table. If the budget is higher, your spending should roughly be done in this order:

- Upgrading the GPU to 1060 or similar

- Upgrading the CPU to i7 or similar

- Upgrading the GPU to RTX 2080

- Upgrading the CPU to i9

- Upgrading the RAM to 64 GB
