Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
=================================

What depth sensing technology is used?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The DaoAI Cameras calculates the depth information of the scene by projecting structured light into the environment. 
This technology allows high resistant to ambient light, and ensures high accuracy in any light environment.


Is the light harmful?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The light are very safe. 
However, please avoid staring into the light directly as it could still cause temporary damages to your eyes and affect your vision.

Safety Standards
--------------------------------------------------------------

All of the DaoAI Cameras are industrial graded, with IP65 rated enclosure, which protects the DaoAI Cameras from low pressure water jets, condensation, and water spray.
On top of that, the cameras also offer high thermal stability, which allows the camera to function reliably in dynamic working conditions.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The Bin Picking Series Cameras weigh from 1.2kg to 5.2kg depending on the camera model:

    - BP-S: 2.3kg
    - BP-M: 5kg
    - BP-L: 5.2kg
    - BP-AMR-GPU: 2.1kg
    - BP-AMR: 1.2kg

The Inspection Series Cameras weigh from 3.7kg to 3.8kg depending on the camera model:

    - IN-XS: 3.8kg
    - IN-S: 3.7kg
    - IN-M: 3.7kg
